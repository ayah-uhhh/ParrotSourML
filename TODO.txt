- Consider pooled CNN
  -- Workflow on gitlab to run large dataset (25k) with different parameter values
- Save / load trained RF / SVM
- Save / load trained CNN??
- Have models consider blue position
    -- Preprocess to have images translated so that blue is always in the EAST

- Run n predictions using n models (RF, SVM, CNN) and weight votes on a single ps datapoint (no answer key)
- Set up local test to ingest single data point for above^^
